# Eagle PCB Design â€“ EE2112 Circuits II Lab

## Project Overview
This project was part of **EE2112: Circuits II Lab** at Michigan Technological University. The assignment was an introduction to **PCB design and fabrication** using Autodesk Eagle.  

My responsibilities included **developing the PCB layout in Eagle, routing traces under design constraints, performing ERC/DRC checks, soldering components, and validating circuit performance in the lab**.  


## Key Contributions
- Designed and optimized a PCB layout in **Autodesk Eagle** from a provided schematic.  
- Routed traces while meeting clearance, spacing, and design rule requirements.  
- Verified design integrity using **Electrical Rule Check (ERC)** and **Design Rule Check (DRC)**.  
- Assembled the PCB by soldering the LM555 timer, 2N2222A transistors, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and other components.  
- Tested the completed board using laboratory equipment to confirm correct timing and LED functionality.  


## Tools & Technologies
- **Software**: Autodesk Eagle  
- **Hardware/Lab**: soldering station, oscilloscope, bench power supply  
- **Components**: LM555 timer, 2N2222A transistors, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, potentiometer  


## Takeaways
This project provided hands-on experience with the full **schematic-to-PCB workflow**, including CAD design, design verification, assembly, and hardware testing. It highlighted the importance of component placement and routing discipline, as well as the value of ERC and DRC in preventing design errors.  

Looking ahead, I am interested in exploring **more compact layouts, surface-mount components, and more advanced design strategies** to expand my PCB design skills.
